Twitter bot that uses APIs to tweet what I get it to

dailySpotifyCount.py 

This script runs at 23.59 daily and collects all the songs I have potentially listened to and gets the length of that list. This length is set to a count variable which is then tweeted as how many songs I have listened to on spotify that day.
